# DNA-ANALYSIS
DNA Sequence Analysis with Machine Learning This project demonstrates how to analyze and classify chimpanzee DNA sequences using machine learning techniques in Python. The workflow covers data preprocessing, feature encoding, classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and unsupervised clustering with K-Means, including visualization with PCA.
